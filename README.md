# My-navy
Our first (and only) project with [signal.h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_signal_handling)   
The point of the project was to transfer data between 2 terminals   
    
```make``` the binary,   
```./navy ${position_file}``` to initalize the game,        
```./navy ${pid of the initialized game} ${position file}``` to join the game,      
and then write a position to shot your attack !      
The game ends when a player has lost all of its boats.
